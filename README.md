# Machine Learning Project Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning Project Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of reports and projects that I have completed as part of my work in the field of Machine Learning. Each project explores different machine learning techniques, models, and applications, highlighting my skills and experience in data analysis, model development, and evaluation. Below is an overview of the projects included in this repository.

## Projects

   - **Summary:** Utilized Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) to generate high-quality manga character images. The project explored the diffusion process and reversed it to create realistic images from noise.
   - **Key Techniques:** DDPM, U-Net, Image Generation.

4. **Handwriting Recognition with CTC**
   - **Summary:** Designed a hybrid model combining CNN and RNN with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) for handwriting recognition on unsegmented sequence data. The model was evaluated using the IAM handwriting dataset.
   - **Key Techniques:** CNN, Bi-directional LSTM, CTC Loss, Residual Blocks.

5. **Audio Classification using CNNs**
   - **Summary:** Applied deep CNNs for keyword spotting using raw waveforms of audio data. The models were evaluated on classification accuracy using time-series data, showcasing the ability to handle raw waveform inputs.
   - **Key Techniques:** CNN, Raw Waveform Processing, Adam Optimizer.

6. **Audio Denoising with Autoencoders**
   - **Summary:** Developed a denoising autoencoder using U-Net architecture to remove noise from audio signals. The project used Mel spectrograms and focused on restoring audio clarity through effective encoder-decoder designs.
